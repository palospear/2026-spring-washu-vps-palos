        This documentary inspires me a lot as it provides a new perspective of what an artist should do. For instance, comparing to the traditional composition, generative art is like being a gardener rather than an architect, which indicates that one can be free from necessarily controlling every detail during art expression. Based on this metaphor of gardening, I also love its discussion of randomness. Since the human brain loves patterns and habits and to transcend this boundary, artist could disrupt those habits by introducing chaos. 
Eno’s Oblique Strategies introduces a concrete method to break out of habitual thinking. The most impressive card is “honor the error as a hidden intention”. This really resonated with me because I often freeze when something goes wrong in my work, especially when I feel the outcome does not match what I imagined. Eno claims that these errors could also be the seeds of original thought. This really helps relieve perfectionism. I prefer viewing the process not as a rigid path but an open exploration, and this idea gives me new insight. Through transitioning the focus from achieving what I consider to be the perfect work to leaving an open space for interpretation and play, I would have an open relationship with the audience and invite them to “do the cooking”.
