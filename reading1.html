        Most websites have already changed their style, generally transitioning from the traditional, personal style to the modern, simple one. It is a pity to learn about this scenario, but after clicking on all the websites provided in this interview, I found that modern versions do have advantages. For instance, there is a stark contrast between Dimesnyc’s website and Johnny’s Luncheonette menu. Full of individual style, Dimesnyc’s fonts are not uniform, and the colors are a bit messy, while Johnny’s Luncheonette offers a relatively simple and clear information presentation, using layout to emphasize priority, such as putting contact and social media info at the bottom of the page with a smaller font size. However, dimesnyc’s website could also leave a more intense impression on potential customers, though sacrificing some degree of convenience. It does not mean that the personality or brand impression cannot be achieved by modern websites. Among the examples, Kajitsu NYC and Domino use repetition of the brand's main colors and logo to associate with the brand. Hibino Brooklyn also showcases an animation of their logo, leaving a strong impression on me.
